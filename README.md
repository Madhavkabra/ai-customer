### 3. Autonomous, Branded Customer Service  
Ada supports scripted automation, but **Twig executes complex tasks** like processing refunds, checking order status, and updating CRM records ‚Äî all without manual escalation. Think of it as a fully trained support rep that works 24/7.

### 4. Omnichannel, Consistent Experience  
Zendesk and Intercom support various channels, but **Twig offers a unified support experience** across chat, email, social, and voice ‚Äî with persistent context and no repetitive handoffs.

### 5. Proactive & Predictive Support
