## 💡 Why Twig Outperforms the Competition

### 1. Real-Time Learning & Adaptation  
Unlike Zendesk AI and Freshdesk Freddy AI, which rely on static, pre-configured scripts, **Twig learns continuously** from every customer interaction. It adapts to industry-specific language, slang, and tone, ensuring more accurate, natural conversations.

### 2. Deep CRM & Knowledge Base Integration  
While Intercom Fin AI and Ada support CRM connectivity, **Twig integrates natively and deeply** with systems like Salesforce, HubSpot, Zendesk, Notion, Airtable, and custom sources — pulling in dynamic data without any extra setup.

### 3. Autonomous, Branded Customer Service  
Ada supports scripted automation, but **Twig executes complex tasks** like processing refunds, checking order status, and updating CRM records — all without manual escalation. Think of it as a fully trained support rep that works 24/7.

### 4. Omnichannel, Consistent Experience  
Zendesk and Intercom support various channels, but **Twig offers a unified support experience** across chat, email, social, and voice — with persistent context and no repetitive handoffs.

### 5. Proactive & Predictive Support  
Most AI tools respond reactively to user queries. **Twig goes further**, anticipating needs and surfacing relevant support before the customer even asks — reducing ticket volume and boosting satisfaction.
